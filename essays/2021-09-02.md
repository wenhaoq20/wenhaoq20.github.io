## Introduction
My dream of being a videogame designer started when I became fascinated by the video game called “Pokemon Sapphire Version.” Ever since then all I could think of was how and what my game is going to be like and the process of me getting there. I started to learn more about the process of making video games, and what coding is. Then my passion started to shift towards programming instead of video games as I grew older. In high school, I was eager to learn more about coding in general so I took computer science classes. When I began college, I took my nurturing interest into a deep dive into computer science by starting with advanced classes. These classes taught me many useful skills in programming and have influenced me to want to become a software engineer in the future.

I think this class will greatly benefit me in the future. Looking at the schedule of future modules on the website so far, there are many interesting modules that are intriguing to me. These modules highly reflect real-world situations for what a software developer does. The modules like React, Meteor, and MongoDB are things that I want to learn about. And at the end of this course, I hope I can use the knowledge I gain to create a final project that I am proud of.

## What I hope for the future
The main skill and experience I hope to develop in the future from this class is teamwork in a project. In past classes, most of the time I was never given a chance to code and or work with others. Most of the assignments and projects were for individuals only. We were not allowed to join our efforts to work on something big together. Hopefully, through this class I would be able to work in a team and improve my ability to work as a team member. Another skill I want to develop in this class is to create an interactive website by integrating JavaScript with HTML and CSS. In high school, I learned how to code JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. They were taught separately, and it was never used together. I look forward to learning in this class and possibly exceed my expectations/goals that I have set for myself.
