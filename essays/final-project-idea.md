## UH Health App
## Overview

The problem: 
Many first-time college students live away from their parents and are on their own for the first time. Some of them might not have experience living healthily and are potentially exposed to many health risks. To improve the students' overall health at UH Manoa, we thought it would be best if students could use a tool/platform to improve their health and connect with other students on campus.

The solution:
Create an app/website available to students that helps to track their eating habits, food intake, and exercise goals as well as calculates approximate calories both intake and burned. This social platform would allow students to connect by helping them find a gym buddy sharing their workouts and favorite HEALTHY recipes. It will send warnings to the student if they are eating unhealthy or need to exercise more.

## Mockup page idea (user):
 * Main page (before sign in)
    * Tabs to go to different pages
      * sign in/sign up
    * Shows some healthy food receipt
    * Shows some facts about health
    * Shows some exercises that you can do at home easily
 * Sign in page/sign up page
 * Main page (after sign in)
    * Tabs to go to different pages
      * user settings
      * eating history/habits
      * exercise history/habits
      * healthy suggestions
    * Shows some healthy food receipt
    * Shows some facts about health
    * Shows some exercises that you can do at home easily
    * Alerts/warnings

Mockup page idea (admin):
 * Main page (before sign in)
    * Sign in
 * Main page (after sign in)
    * Different tabs
      * Edit page
      * Add page
      * Check overall stats about the students
   
## Use case ideas:
 * New users will be prompted with a sign-in page where they can create a new account connected to their UH email account/ID. They then input basic information about them and the app will automatically give them suggestions.
 * Admin users will be able to log in through the sign-in page. After signing in they will be able to see individual studentsâ€™ statistics and overall student statistics with a graph of the overall health of the students. 
 * Returning users will be sent to the home page after log in where they can go to different pages to either post, log meals, input workouts, or connect.

## Beyond the basics:
 * Push notifications to their devices (text, emails)
 * Two-factor authentication
 * Ratings for the food receipt and workouts
 * location tracking (if user permits)
    * sends alerts when near healthy restaurants
    * gives "healthier options" when near unhealthy restaurants
    * Finds nearby gym buddy
 * Allow for individuals to share their information anonymously
