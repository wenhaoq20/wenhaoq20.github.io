## Encounter with JavaScript

I was excited when I heard that we were going to cover JavaScript in ICS 314 because JavaScript was one of the first coding languages that I have learned. It was this initial exposure to JavaScript that helped me transition to other languages such as Java, Python, C, and C++. When I was completing all of the basic JavaScript lessons in the assignment E06: Intro to Javascript, it was a refresher for me until I tried doing the ES6 learning module. Everything I thought I knew about JavaScript was outdated, all of the things I had learned were now replaced with current standards. It was a brand new experience for me; it’s like learning a new language. It made JavaScript more complex and better.

## Perspective on JavaScript

Initially, I thought JavaScript was another language similar to Java, but I was completely wrong. Besides the similarity of the word Java in their names, there are too many differences between JavaScript and Java. Java is an Object-Oriented Programming language while JavaScript is an Object-Oriented Scripting language. JavaScript does not need a compiler to translate the code while Java needs a compiler to translate. Java creates programs that either operate in a virtual machine or browser while JavaScript only runs on the browser. These are only some of the basic differences between Java and Javascript as the list goes on. From a software engineering perspective, I think JavaScript is a cool and good language. It is an easy-to-learn language for beginners in this field, it’s flexible and modern. Overall, it’s a great gateway language into the intricacies of computer science and definitely something worthwhile to add to your coding knowledge base.

## Athletic Software Engineering and WODs

I think athletic software engineering and WODs are great ways to push my limits. When I started the first WOD exercise, I was stressed out because the WOD exercise was timed and it was either a pass or fail. My mind was all over the place, I was rushing through the exercise, making more mistakes than usual. After completing the WOD exercise, I was relieved. I started getting used to it after multiple practices, it was similar to a coding test or an exam. Practicing is the key to better understanding the problem and making fewer mistakes. Right now, I think WODs are very helpful and I look forward to completing more of them in the future.
