Pokemon Maybe is an attempt from me to try to recreate the famous game Pokemon for my AP computer science class back in high school. This game is a text-based adventure game with a map that contained different enemies at random locations. The game is not fully complete. Currently, the user can pick which pokemon they want to start with first. Each Pokemon have different properties like their type, moves, and stats. The user can go around the map and choose to fight all of the enemies. As the user defeats each enemy, the pokemon will level up along with their stats making them stronger. The game has a save and load function where the user can save their current progress and keep it for next time. The user can either choose to type out the command or use the GUI to play the game. This was the first major project I coded in Java. In this project, I learned a lot about classes (abstract classes, hierarchy), and different libraries like JFrame, JButton, JLabel, JPanel, JTextArea, and Color.
